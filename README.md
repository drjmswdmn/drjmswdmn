im a senior geologist at @arup-group within the london rock mechanics team. 

i work on rock mechanics, rock engineering and applied geology projects across the civil engineering, mining, nuclear and defence sectors. i also have on-going research interests in laboratory rock mechanics experiments, Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling, and the thermo-mechanical loading of rock.

i dont do anything special here, im just trying to make life easier for myself and colleagues, automating simple tasks, improving]numerical modelling workflows and streamlining data processing and visualisation.
